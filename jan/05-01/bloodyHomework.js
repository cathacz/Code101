// I thought tomorrow is off and it will be nice to practice a bit more, so here are some fun exercises >> we have a different understanding from "fun" ;)

// MATH – Perform Mathematical Tasks with JavaScript. Remember: you must use the Math functions and print all results to the console!

function display (str) {
    console.log(str);
}
display("Math-Stuff");

// 1. Minimum and maximum
display("Minimun & Maximum:");
// a. Lowest Number >> Print out the lowest number between -1 and 4.
display(Math.min(-1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4));
// b. Highest Number >> Print out the highest number between -1 and 4.
display(Math.max(-1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4));
// 2. Rounding
display("Rounding:");
// a. Round up >> Round up each of the following numbers to the nearest integer: 3321.32321, 326.76, 76788.7, -9.78, 43.342.
// b. Round down >> Round down each of the following numbers to the nearest integer: 3321.32321, 326.76, 76788.7, -9.78, 28.329.
// Strings and Numbers
display("Strings and Numbers:");
// 1. Concatenation.
// Create two variables. One variable should contain a string value and the other should contain a number. Concatenate the string and the number.
// let introSentence = "Hi, my name is Nancy and I am";
// let age = 25;
// Expected Output:
// "Hi, my name is Nancy and I am 25"
// In this case, what is the + operator doing? Comment your answer in the js file.
// 2. Converting
// Create a variable with the value of “1005”. Convert it to a number.
// Create a variable with the value of “10.05". Convert it to a number.
