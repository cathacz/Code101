// Blocking vs Non-Blocking code
// Blocking code
// blacking code(loops, console.log, loading files )
// Non-blocking code

// Promises
// Promises are very similar to callbacks but they are a little bit clean on writing
// Promises are the best solution if you want to do something that takes a long time to be done and you don't want your app to wait for it to be done, so it will work on the background, Like downloading an image or a video from another server

// Promisify setTimeout
